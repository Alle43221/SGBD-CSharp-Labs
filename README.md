# SGBD C# Project

This repository contains my first C# application developed as part of a Database Management Systems (SGBD) project. 
The project focuses on database interaction, basic CRUD operations, and implementing a functional desktop application using C# and SQL.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:
- Connecting a C# application to a relational database.
- Executing SQL queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- Displaying and manipulating data through an intuitive user interface.
- Applying core concepts studied in Database Management Systems courses.
- Using a parent-child table template which can be later adapted for other data.
